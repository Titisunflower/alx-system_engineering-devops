### Issue Summary:

Duration: June 15, 2023, 08:00 - June 15, 2023, 12:00 (UTC)
Impact: An outage affecting our customer authentication service resulted in login failures and restricted access for 20% of our users during the four-hour duration.

### Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was an underlying database query optimization issue that gradually led to increased query response times, ultimately causing the authentication service to become unresponsive.

### Timeline:

* 08:00: Outage detected as monitoring alerts indicated a surge in authentication service errors and latency.
* 08:15: Initial assumption made that network connectivity might be compromised, leading to connectivity issues with the authentication servers.
* 08:30: Network team conducted thorough checks and confirmed that network connectivity was functioning optimally, ruling out connectivity as the cause.
* 08:45: Incident escalated to the database team, considering a potential database overload causing delayed query responses.
* 09:00: Database team identified some slow-running queries but deemed them unrelated to the issue and redirected focus to the application layer.
* 09:30: Developers began investigating the application code, suspecting a bug or bottleneck in the authentication service logic.
* 10:00: Further analysis revealed a gradual degradation of database performance due to suboptimal query execution plans.
* 10:30: Incident escalated to senior developers and database administrators for a joint investigation into the database performance issue.
* 11:00: Root cause identified: query optimization issue causing inefficient execution plans for specific authentication-related queries.
* 11:30: Database administrators applied necessary query optimizations and performance-tuning techniques to rectify the slow query problem.
* 12:00: The authentication service was successfully restarted, and users regained access and authentication functionality.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause was traced to a database query optimization issue that led to progressively slower query performance. The inefficient query execution plans caused delayed responses, eventually rendering the authentication service unresponsive.

To address the issue, the database administrators restructured the problematic queries, optimized indexes, and updated statistics to ensure optimal execution plans. These improvements significantly enhanced query performance. The authentication service was then restarted to apply the changes and restore full functionality.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

<ol>
  <li><em><strong>Regular Database Performance Audits</strong></em>: Implement a schedule for routine database performance audits to proactively identify and address query optimization issues before they impact critical services.</li>
  <li><em><strong>Query Monitoring and Alerting</strong></em>: Set up real-time query monitoring and alerting mechanisms to quickly identify and respond to deteriorating query performance.</li>
  <li><em><strong>Code Review and Optimization</strong></em>: Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and optimize resource-intensive or slow-performing queries, ensuring efficient database interactions.</li>
  <li><em><strong>Database Maintenance</strong></em>: Regularly update database statistics and perform index optimization to maintain optimal query execution plans.</li>
<li><em><strong>Load Testing</strong></em>: Develop and execute comprehensive load testing scenarios to simulate peak usage and identify potential performance bottlenecks.</li>
</ol>

### Tasks to Address the Issue:

<ol>
  <li>Review and optimize all database queries related to the authentication service to ensure efficient execution plans.</li>
  <li>Implement a recurring database performance audit to catch and rectify any emerging query optimization issues.</li>
  <li>Set up real-time monitoring and alerts for query performance degradation to enable swift response and intervention.</li>
  <li>Schedule routine maintenance to update database statistics and optimize indexes for sustained query performance.</li>
<li>Conduct a post-incident review and share findings with the development and operations teams to enhance cross-functional awareness and knowledge sharing.</li>
</ol>

In summary, the outage stemmed from a query optimization issue in the database, leading to authentication service degradation. Timely detection, collaborative investigation, and effective query optimization strategies were instrumental in restoring service and minimizing user impact. By implementing corrective and preventative measures, we aim to bolster our system's resilience and maintain a seamless user experience.
