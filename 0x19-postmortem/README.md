### Issue Summary:

Duration: August 2, 2023, 13:45 - August 2, 2023, 15:30 (UTC)
Impact: A 30-minute outage affecting our online payment service, causing slow transactions and service unavailability for approximately 15% of our users.

### Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was a database connection leak due to an unhandled code path in the payment processing module. This led to excessive connections being opened to the database, causing a bottleneck and subsequent service degradation.

### Timeline:

* 13:45: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden increase in response times and error rates for the payment service.
* 13:50: Engineering team initiated investigation, suspecting a potential database issue due to historical incidents.
* 14:00: Assumed the database server might be running low on resources, leading to slow queries.
* 14:15: Database server's resource usage was thoroughly analyzed, but no significant anomalies were found.
* 14:30: Focused on load balancer configuration, suspecting it might be distributing traffic unevenly, causing degradation for specific users.
* 14:45: Load balancer configuration was validated and found to be correct, ruling out load balancing as the cause.
* 15:00: Incident escalated to the database administration team as no immediate solution was identified.
* 15:15: Database administrators discovered the excessive connection issue, pinpointing the root cause to the payment processing code.
* 15:30: The incident was resolved by restarting the affected payment service instances, which released the leaked database connections and restored normal operations.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was an unhandled code path in the payment processing module that resulted in database connections not being properly closed after processing transactions. As a result, these connections accumulated over time, eventually overwhelming the database server.

To resolve the issue, the engineering team identified and fixed the code path responsible for the connection leak. Additionally, a comprehensive code review was conducted to ensure similar issues did not exist elsewhere. The affected payment service instances were restarted to release the excess connections and restore database performance.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

<ol>
  <li>Code Review and Testing: Implement stricter code reviews to identify potential code paths that might lead to resource leaks. Enhance unit and integration testing to catch such issues before deployment.</li>
  <li>Database Connection Pooling: Implement a robust database connection pooling strategy to ensure connections are properly managed and released after use.</li>
  <li>Monitoring and Alerts: Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively detect and respond to unusual resource usage patterns and database connection leaks.</li>
  <li>Automated Testing: Develop automated tests to simulate and identify resource leaks during continuous integration and deployment pipelines.</li>
<li>Documentation: Maintain a comprehensive documentation repository detailing common debugging and troubleshooting steps for various services and components.</li>
</ol>

### Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch the payment processing module to handle database connections properly and ensure connections are released after use.
Conduct a thorough review of all code paths related to database interactions to identify and rectify potential connection leaks.
Implement database connection pooling to manage and optimize database connections efficiently.
Update monitoring and alerting configurations to provide early detection of similar incidents in the future.
Develop automated tests to simulate and identify resource leaks in critical modules.
Share the incident findings and lessons learned across the engineering team to enhance awareness and knowledge sharing.
In conclusion, the outage was caused by an unhandled code path resulting in a database connection leak. Swift detection, thorough investigation, and collaboration across teams led to a successful resolution. By implementing corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents and improve our overall system stability and reliability.
