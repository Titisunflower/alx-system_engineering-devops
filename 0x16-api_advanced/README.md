This repository contains a Python project that involves interacting with the Reddit API to practice various API-related tasks. The tasks include querying the API, retrieving data, and performing operations on the results. These tasks are commonly encountered in technical interviews and can help you become more comfortable with working with APIs.

## Background

They range from simple tasks like querying an API endpoint to more complex tasks that involve recursion, data manipulation, and formatting. To prepare for such questions, this project provides practice with the Reddit API, which has a variety of available endpoints that offer opportunities for parsing and presenting data.
